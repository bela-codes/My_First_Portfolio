            <h1>Thor</h1>
            <p>God Of Thunder!</p>

            <h2>The Birth and Raising of Thor</h2>
            <p>In the golden realm of Asgard, nestled high among the stars and shimmering skies, the god Thor was born. His mother, Jörð, was the spirit of the Earth—strong, wild, and patient. His father, Odin Allfather, was the wise and powerful king of the gods. From the moment Thor opened his eyes, thunder rumbled in the distance, as if the skies themselves recognized their future son.</p>
            <p>As a child, Thor was not quiet or gentle. He would wrestle with the storm clouds, chase lightning across the Bifrost Bridge, and laugh as thunder clapped with his every stomp. He grew up under the watchful eyes of Frigg, Odin’s queen, and the guidance of his older brother, Balder, who taught him mercy. Yet it was warriors like Tyr and Sif who helped him train in the arts of battle.</p>
            <p>Thor spent his early years in the Fields of Vingolf, where he tested his strength against mighty beasts and sparred with gods. He once challenged a mountain giant before he could even lift a hammer—and though the giant laughed, Thor swore he’d return stronger.</p>
            <p>By the time he came of age, Thor had earned the right to wield Mjölnir, the enchanted hammer forged in the heart of a dying star. From then on, he became the protector of both Asgard and Midgard, the realm of humans.</p>
            <p>But he never forgot his roots. Though a god of thunder, Thor was also a child of the Earth, and in every storm he summoned, you could still hear the roaring voice of the boy raised in the halls of gods—fierce, loyal, and full of thunder. ⚡</p>
            <h3>Thor vs. the Stone Troll (Young Thor)</h3>
            <p>Before Mjölnir, before glory, there was only a boy with a wooden club.</p>
            <p>In the woods of Asgard, a Stone Troll had wandered too close to the golden walls. Young Thor, barely tall enough to reach a warrior’s belt, stood in its path.</p>
            <p>“You’re not welcome here!” Thor yelled, gripping his makeshift club.</p>
            <p>The troll laughed, but Thor charged anyway. His swing cracked the troll’s kneecap. The beast roared, swiping at the boy, but Thor ducked and rolled beneath its legs.</p>
            <p>With one final leap, Thor smashed the club between the troll’s eyes. The troll collapsed, stunned.</p>
            <p>Odin watched from afar, nodding. The boy had heart.</p>
            <h3>Thor vs. The Storm Serpent (Teen Thor)</h3>
            <p>The skies above Asgard darkened as Jörmungandr’s child, a rogue storm serpent, slithered through the clouds.</p>
            <p>Thor, now stronger and reckless with pride, soared toward it with his new hammer, Mjölnir.</p>
            <p>“You call that thunder?” he growled.</p>
            <p>The serpent struck first, lightning in its eyes and venom in its fangs. Thor was knocked into a mountain, but he laughed as he stood.</p>
            <p>With a whirl of Mjölnir, he rose again—this time faster, focused.</p>
            <p>With one perfect throw, the hammer crashed through the serpent’s chest. The skies cleared. Thor hovered in silence, humbled by the power he'd just tamed.</p>
