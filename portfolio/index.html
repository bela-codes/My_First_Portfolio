            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Abel Tesfaye. I'm currently studying Electromechanical Engineering at AASTU. I'm passionate about building and creating—whether it's hardware systems like robots or software projects like web apps. I'm also on a journey to become a skilled developer who blends engineering with intelligent technology.

            Outside of school, I enjoy learning new programming languages, designing interfaces in Figma, and exploring how artificial intelligence can be used to solve real-life problems. I’m currently focused on strengthening my skills in HTML, Python, and JavaScript, while also learning more about robotics and control systems.
